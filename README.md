4. Solution4.py asks user to enter a postive integer and calculates the following, calculates next value by taking current value      and if it is even divide by 2 and if odd multiply by 3 and add 1. Program will end when current value is one.

5. Solution5.py asks user to enter a positive integer and tells user whether or not number is a prime number.





6. Solution6.py asks user to enter a sentence and outputs every second word
